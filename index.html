	<h1> Boomerang's </h1>
		<p>A boomerang is a thrown tool, typically constructed as a flat aero foil, 
		that is designed to spin about an axis perpendicular to the direction of its flight. 
		A returning boomerang is designed to return to the thrower. It is well known as a weapon 
		used by Indigenous Australians for hunting.
		</p>
	
	<h2> Hunting with a Boomerang </h2>
		<p>Traditionally, most boomerangs used by aboriginal groups in Australia were 
		'non-returning'. These weapons, sometimes called "throwsticks" or "kylies", were 
		used for hunting a variety of prey, from kangaroos to parrots; at a range of about 
		one hundred meters, a 2-kg non-returning boomerang could inflict mortal injury to a 
		large animal.[1] A throwstick thrown nearly horizontally may fly in a nearly straight 
		path and could fell a kangaroo on impact to the legs or knees, while the long-necked 
		emu could be killed by a blow to the neck.[citation needed] Hooked non-returning 
		boomerangs, known as "beaked kylies", used in northern Central Australia, have been 
		claimed to kill multiple birds when thrown into a dense flock. It should be noted 
		that throwsticks are used as multi-purpose tools by today's aboriginal peoples,
		 and besides throwing could be wielded as clubs, used for digging, used to start 
		 friction fires, and are sonorous when two are struck together. </p>
		 
	<h2> Design </h2>
		<p> A returning boomerang is a rotating wing. Though it is not a requirement that the 
		boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat. A falling boomerang starts 
		spinning, and most then fall in a spiral. When the boomerang is thrown with high spin, 
		the wings produce lift. Because of its rapid spinning, a boomerang flies in a curve rather 
		than a straight line. When thrown correctly, a boomerang returns to its starting point. </p>

		<p>Returning boomerangs consist of two or more arms, or wings, connected at an angle. 
		Each wing is shaped as an airfoil.</p>
	
		<p>As the wing rotates and the boomerang moves through the air, this creates airflow over 
		the wings and this creates lift on both "wings". However, during one-half of each blade's rotation, 
		it sees a higher airspeed, because the rotation tip-speed and the forward speed add, and when it is 
		in the other half of the rotation, the tip speed subtracts from the forward speed. Thus if thrown nearly 
		upright each blade generates more lift at the top than the bottom. </p>

		<p>While it might be expected that this would cause the boomerang to tilt around the axis of travel, 
		because the boomerang has significant angular momentum, gyroscopic effect causes the plane of 
		rotation to tilt about an axis that is 90 degrees to the direction of flight, and this is what 
		curves the flight in such a way that it will tend to return. </p>

		<p>Thus gyroscopic precession is what makes the boomerang return to the thrower when thrown 
		correctly. This is also what makes the boomerang fly straight up into the air when thrown 
		incorrectly. With the exception of long-distance boomerangs, they should not be thrown sidearm 
		or like a Frisbee, but rather thrown with the long axis of the wings rotating in an almost-vertical plane. </p>

		<p>Fast Catch boomerangs usually have three or more symmetrical wings (in the planform view), 
		whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped similar to a question mark. Maximum 
		Time Aloft boomerangs mostly have one wing considerably longer than the other. This feature, 
		along with carefully executed bends and twists in the wings help to set up an 'auto-rotation' 
		effect to maximise the boomerang's hover-time in descending from the highest point in its flight. </p>

		<p>Some boomerangs have turbulatorsâ€”bumps or pits on the top surface that act to increase 
		the lift as boundary layer transition activators (to keep attached turbulent flow instead 
		of laminar separation). </p>
		
	<h2> How to throw a Boomerang </h2>
	
	<h3> Getting Started </h3>
		<ol>
			<li> <strong> Find a large, open area. </strong> You will need to find a 
			large, open space where you can safely throw your boomerang, without losing
			 it. In general, you will want an area where you have at least 50 meters 
			 (164.0 ft) of space on all sides. Football fields, soccer pitches and open 
			 park spaces are all good options. Make sure there are not too many trees or 
			 bushes for your boomerang to get caught in, or large bodies of water for it 
			 to fall into. </li>
			 
			 <li> <strong> Watch out for weather conditions. </strong> Wind is one of 
			 the most important factors in the proper return of a boomerang. Ideally, 
			 you want a nice calm day, with winds between 0 to 10 mph (16 km/h). 
			 Some boomerangs will not return in completely calm weather, but most will. 
			 Avoid throwing your boomerang in anything above a moderate wind, as it will 
			 distort the path of the boomerang and throw it off course. </li>
