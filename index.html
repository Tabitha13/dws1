	<h1> Boomerang's </h1>
		<p>A boomerang is a thrown tool, typically constructed as a flat aero foil, 
		that is designed to spin about an axis perpendicular to the direction of its flight. 
		A returning boomerang is designed to return to the thrower. It is well known as a weapon 
		used by Indigenous Australians for hunting.

	<h3> Hunting with a Boomerang </h3>
		<p>Traditionally, most boomerangs used by aboriginal groups in Australia were 
		'non-returning'. These weapons, sometimes called "throwsticks" or "kylies", were 
		used for hunting a variety of prey, from kangaroos to parrots; at a range of about 
		one hundred meters, a 2-kg non-returning boomerang could inflict mortal injury to a 
		large animal.[1] A throwstick thrown nearly horizontally may fly in a nearly straight 
		path and could fell a kangaroo on impact to the legs or knees, while the long-necked 
		emu could be killed by a blow to the neck.[citation needed] Hooked non-returning 
		boomerangs, known as "beaked kylies", used in northern Central Australia, have been 
		claimed to kill multiple birds when thrown into a dense flock. It should be noted 
		that throwsticks are used as multi-purpose tools by today's aboriginal peoples,
		 and besides throwing could be wielded as clubs, used for digging, used to start 
		 friction fires, and are sonorous when two are struck together. </p>
